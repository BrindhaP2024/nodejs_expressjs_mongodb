You can't run the debugger and your server on the same port. Using --inspect-brk=localhost:3000 tells it to run the debugger on port 3000 which is where your server already is. Why are you passing a port number for --inspect-brk at all? –

@jfriend00, I didn't run them at the same time, I tried to run debugger on the same port like the way I run my server without debugger. Because my client is using port 3000 to reach my server. –

@jfriend00, I think I got what you meant, --inspect-brk=localhost:3000 will try to attach debugger to the same port as the server is running. I didn't realize server and debugger are different process. –
